# Session Summary: 2026-02-20

## Core Objective
Refining the Practix.org layout architecture, prioritizing mobile-first rendering logic, executing a targeted SEO audit, and standardizing cross-page navigation components.

## Key Accomplishments & Fixes

1. **Strategic SEO Audit (Formulas)**
   - Naturally integrated the high-value keywords "digital sat math" and "sat math practice" into the `formulas/index.html` meta description and hero paragraph.
   - Executed `update_seo.py`, `generate_sitemap.py`, and `inject_schema.py` to propagate the meta updates sitewide.

2. **App Page Refinements (Mobile Isolation Architecture)**
   - **Table Line Breaks:** Replaced standard inline text within the "Study vs. Train" comparison table with a rigid `.desktop-only` / `.mobile-only` dual-span architecture. This bypassed a nasty Safari WebKit bug involving `<br>` tags and guaranteed precise two/three-line rendering for "Core Method", "Old Way (Studying)", and "Practix Way (Training)".
   - **Character Fracturing (The Parenthesis Bug):** Nullified an aggressive global `word-break: break-word` rule on mobile table headers. Reallocated column widths (25% / 37.5% / 37.5%) to provide the physical pixel footprint required to render the word `(Studying)` completely intact on narrow iPhone SE viewports.
   - **Content Clutter Removal:** Eradicated the redundant "Ready to Master the Shortcuts?" mid-article CTA and the entire "Related Resources" section from the bottom of the App page to enhance visual flow into "The Decision" section.

3. **The 'Join Beta' Arrow & Color Collapse**
   - Diagnosed a severe layout collapse on the bottom "Join 1,200+ Students in Beta" button. The text was wrapping and destroying the UI on narrow devices.
   - Reduced text length strictly on mobile via the `.mobile-only` span ("Join 1,200+ Students →").
   - Stripped massive, hardcoded inline CSS (`padding`, `font-size`) replacing it with a responsive `.decision-btn` media query class.
   - Discovered and neutralized a catastrophic global typo in `styles.v4.css` (`span { color: var(--text-secondary) }`) which was forcing the newly wrapped button text to render as dark gray. Enforced a highly specific `.decision-btn span` override to lock the text to `#ffffff` and `white-space: nowrap`.

4. **Homepage Simplification**
   - Removed the redundant `homepage-terminal-zone` (navigation grid and system HUD block) from `index.html` to streamline user entry paths.

## Diagnostics & Tools Used
- Leveraged the `browser_subagent` to visually verify DOM updates on live mobile resolutions.
- Used strict query string cache-busters (`?v=clear4`) to penetrate and bypass aggressive CDN edge-caching during rapid QA iterations.
